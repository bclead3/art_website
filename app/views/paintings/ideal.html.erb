      <p>As I pursue the act of pleine aire painting it becomes a process of not only painting but also of staying in the moment; a meditational device that keeps me in the present and seeing clearly. When that actually happens it promotes a wonderful connection between nature and the mind, an ideal realized.</p>

      <p>Iâ€™m working at obtaining the ideal, a symbolic truth that can heighten my awareness to what is around me. And though I struggle at it, my desire to gain the abilities to capture one particular instant will keep me painting for a long time.</p>
